    One of our first tasks at Dev Bootcamp was to find out our
    <a href=http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html> thinking style </a>
    I figured out that I am the abstract sequential thinker. The definition says that abstract sequential thinkers "love the world of theory and abstract thought". True it is.
    What does this mean for me? For me it is important to get various input: pictures, texts, different types of tasks etc. I like being challenged and the mixture of working on challenges on my own and pairing on challenges. However, as soon as certain types of task start repeating, I need to take care not to get bored and not to skimm important information. Being aware of this, is my biggest help.
