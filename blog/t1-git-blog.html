		<h5> Version control </h5>
		As the name already implicates: version control is used to manage different versions of a product (e.g. programs and files in the context of web development). It allows people to either lock files in order to make them accessable and editable for only one person. Or it may track changes that are made to files and programs. When tracking, version control saves different states of the coding process. This enables multiple persons to work on a project at the same time and merge their work afterwards. Furthermore, bugs can be found more easily since programer just have to review the previous code for debugging. There are many different version control systems. However the two most popular ones for developers are Subversion (a.k.a. SVN) and Git.

        <h5> How git tracks changes </h5>
		Git is an open-source version control system that tracks changes you make to coding files in projects. It considers coding files as a sort of tree. Each time you change or add something to your code the latest version is added to the original as a new branch. Finally, you can merge those branches with the original version and make them one code.

        <h5> Benefits of using GitHub to store code </h5> 
		GitHub is an open source version control system. One of its biggest advantage is, that it is distributed. This means that you can clone a project an work on the entire project history on your computer - without interacting with a server. Further, it stores a copy of your project's repository as a backup. It uses markdown (a simple way to write that is used by text-editors) and therefor makes it easy for us by not having to learn another formatting system. Last but not least, GitHub offers its users great service by offering help, guides and great documentation.
