  <h2>What is the difference between arrays and hashes?</h2>

    <p> Arrays and Hashes are two ways of storing and accessing data. They allow you to collect an amount of keyword, numbers etc. </p>
    <h5> Arrays </h5>
    <p>
    Arrays are basically just lists. They can list objects like strings, integers, floats or other arrays. You can use arrays when you just want to store a list of items.

    Example: favorite_animals = [“turtles", “cats", “dogs", “birds"]
    </p>
    <h5> Hashes </h5>
    <p> Hashes are pretty similar to arrays. However, the difference is that  hashes store two kinds of information: key and value. In this context the value defines the key by adding it a sort of definition.
    Example: personal_information={:last_name => "Buck", :first_name => "Katharina", :age => 100}
    </p>
