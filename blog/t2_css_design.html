  <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h2>

    <p> When talking about the CSS box model (boxes that are created for objects in html/CSS), you'll come across margin, border and padding, too. Boxes consist of different layers. Just have a brief look at the following image to get a brief understanding of the concept.

    <h5> Margin </h5>
    Margin is the area outside the object. It defines spaces between two objects. The more you increase the margin the larger becomes the space between those two objects.If you set margin to "auto" the document automatically centers your object.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h5> Border </h5>
    Border is just the edge of an object. Borders can be made visible or not. In case you want to make them visible you have to define them with "border:" and set a value concerning thickness (e.g. 1px), character (e.g. solid) and color (e.g. black)
    </p>

    <p>
        <h5> Padding </h5>
    Padding is the inner space right between the border and the boxe's content. You can set the same padding to all sides by just putting "padding:" and setting one value (e.g. padding: 30px;).
