  <h1>Object Oriented versus Functional Programming</h1>
  <h4>September 6, 2015</h4>

    <p>
There are different programming languages out there. Two popular styles of programming, are functional and Object Oriented programming. The key difference is that the funcitonal programming deals with "functions", and object oriented programming deals with objects. What this really means will be explained below.</p>

<h5>Object Oriented Programming</h5>

These types of languages deal with "objects". Objects are just... things! As real-world things have properties, like size, weight or color, so do objects. Objects also have "methods" that they can do.

<h5>Functional Programming</h5>

<p>Functional Programming deals with "functions". Where Object Oriented languages deal in "things" and "stuff", Functional languages deal in numbers and equations. In Functional Programming your data should always stay the same, and any new bit of information. If your function works once, it will work again and again.</p>
