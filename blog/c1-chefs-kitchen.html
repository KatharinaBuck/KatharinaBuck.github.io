    Although DBC does not want to be the menu in a restaurant where you get something offered and pay a certain price in return for it, that was exactly the way I decided to apply for the program: I simply wanted to learn coding.
	Although my first decision for DBC was pretty rational, I consider myself as a person who is keen on learning new stuff, interested in people and other opinions and setting great importance to not simply do something but seeing the big picture. And that was exactly what DBC offered, as I realized after having submitted my application.
	Since then, I am experiencing something completely new:
	I am sitting on the other side of the world but I have never felt left alone with coding. Having a bunch of things to learn and to practice, I have not felt stressed for a second but inspired and motivated. I love the mixture of reading, learning, coding and communicating with others about what we have learned. I love the community, it really feels like a community although we have just virtually met a few days ago.
	Therefor, I am really excited to participate in this promising program. I am looking forward to meeting all the other students in real life and to share a great learning experience with them.
