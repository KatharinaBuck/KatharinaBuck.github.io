  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>September 6, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>
Stereotype Threat is when a person fears to accept and confirm negative stereotypes concerning their cultural/social group. As you spend quite a lot of time and effort to avoid it, you finally end up confirming it yourself.
The question is just if we have to accept it the way it is or try to change something about it. We need to be aware to see in others not just what we're seeing but believe in something unexpected, be open-minded and just recall that our brains are used to stereotypes.
It's hard and sometimes I end up doing what everyone expects me to do, act like a girl, the version of me that's not exactly me, but is a part of me, or at least that's what everyone tells me.
