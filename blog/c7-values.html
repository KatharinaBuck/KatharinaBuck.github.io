<p>
  This article is about values that are important to me. See my top six values below. I labled them with numbers that give the amount of how strongly I agree with living up to these values (1=disagree, 5=agree).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Freedom: 4</li>
  <li>Independence: 4</li>
  <li>Inner harmony: 5</li>
  <li>Meaningful work: 5</li>
  <li>Mentorship: 4</li>
  <li>Wisdom: 4</li>
</ol>

<h3>Independence</h3>
<p> Independence is one of the most important values to me. Why? I think it is very valuable to have your own thoughts and not always being influenced by what other people think or ask you to do. Get inspired by others but make up your own mind, be reflective, be brave and come up with new solutions instead of just fulfilling what is asked from you to do.
</p>
<h3>Values, Advice and Stereotype threat</h3>
<p> I try to stick to my values at any time. They might be especially influencal in situations when you have to give advice or when you're challenged to deal with strerotype threat. Sometimes you forget about them but still, I, personally try to think about my true values are from time to time in order to have them as present as possible and rely on them as often as possible - in any kind of situation.
